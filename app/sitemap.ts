/**
 * Sitemap - marketing / static pages only.
 *
 * We deliberately do NOT enumerate individual user profiles. Auto-dumping
 * every handle to search engines is a privacy problem (users never opt into
 * being indexed) and exposes sensitive usernames sitewide. Profiles are still
 * reachable and individually indexable when someone shares them - we just
 * don't hand the entire user table to crawlers and recon tools.
 *
 * If we ever want a curated subset for SEO (e.g. the top leaderboard
 * profiles), add them here explicitly rather than listing everyone.
