# scars.meow Discord Bot

Marketplace + moderation bot for scars.meow. Public commands for looking up profiles, browsing the template marketplace, and redeeming premium codes.

## Quick start (local)

```bash
cd discord-bot
cp .env.example .env      # fill in your values
npm install
npm run dev               # uses .env, watches for changes
```

## Deploy to Railway

1. Create a Discord Application at <https://discord.com/developers/applications>. Add a Bot, enable **Server Members Intent** + **Message Content Intent**, copy the token.
2. Invite to your server:
   ```
   https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&permissions=2147485696&scope=bot%20applications.commands
   ```
3. Push this directory to a GitHub repo. On Railway -> New Project -> Deploy from GitHub. Railway auto-detects `railway.toml`.
4. Set the env vars listed in `.env.example`. At minimum:
   - `DISCORD_TOKEN`, `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`, `DISCORD_GUILD_ID`
   - `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - `LOG_CHANNEL_ID` (optional but recommended)
   - `LEADERBOARD_CHANNEL_ID` + `STAFF_CHANNEL_ID` (optional - skip a scheduled task by leaving its channel blank)
5. Deploy. Watch the logs for:
   ```
   [Bot] ✅ Logged in as halo bot#1234
   [command-handler] ✅ Registered N guild commands
   [cron] registered 3 tasks
   ```

`DISCORD_GUILD_ID` makes slash registration instant (vs up to an hour for global commands).

## Database setup

Run the migrations under `../scripts/`. The latest required for the bot is `050_discord_bot_infrastructure.sql` which creates four tables:

- `discord_audit_log` - durable audit trail
- `bot_admins` - who can run admin commands (seeded with the owner)
- `bot_scheduled_tasks` - cron run ledger
- `bot_rate_limits` - destructive-command rate limit buckets

All four have RLS enabled with no policies; only the service role can read or write them.

## How permissions work

Permission gating is enforced server-side by a middleware in `framework/command-handler.js`. Every command declares a `meta.permission` tier:

- `public` - anyone in the guild can run it. Default member permissions are stripped so Discord shows the command to everyone.
- `admin` - looked up against the `bot_admins` table (60s in-memory cache). Discord hides the command from non-admins via `default_member_permissions='0'`.
- `owner` - only the row in `bot_admins` with `is_owner=true`.

To grant admin without a redeploy: `/admin grant @discord-user`. The cache invalidates immediately. To revoke: `/admin revoke @discord-user`. The owner row can't be revoked through the command; edit the table directly if you ever need to transfer ownership.

`BOT_OWNER_ID` env var acts as a backstop if the table ever ends up empty.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Bot offline / not starting | Railway logs - look for `❌ Missing required env vars` |
| Slash commands not showing | `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` set? Was bot invited with `applications.commands` scope? |
| `Login failed` | Regenerate the bot token in the Discord Developer Portal |
| DB errors | Use the **service_role** key, not the anon key |
| Commands report rate-limited | Destructive commands are capped 5/min/admin |
| Scheduled tasks not running | Confirm `[cron] registered 3 tasks` appears in startup logs |
| Daily stats / leaderboard not posting | The matching channel env var must be set AND the bot must be in that channel |
